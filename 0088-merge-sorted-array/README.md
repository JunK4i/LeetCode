<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-sorted-array">88. Merge Sorted Array</a></h2><h3>Easy</h3>

<h3>
Solution Notes:
For arrays already sorted, best solution is to use loops and 3 pointers. 
<br/>
End while loop when 2nd array is expended. 
If 1st array is not expended and 1st array element greater than 2nd, add to end of list
Else if 1st array expended or 2nd element greater, add to end of list
<br/>
In the case where both is equal, remove from 2nd array first, then subsequent iteration, 1st condition will trigger (since 1st array sitll has element) 
In the case where there are no elements in 1st array, will copy 2nd array. 
In the case where there are no elements in 2nd array, loop will end immediately

<hr><p>You are given two integer arrays <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code>, sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>, and two integers <code>m</code> and <code>n</code>, representing the number of elements in <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Merge</strong> <code>nums1</code> and <code>nums2</code> into a single array sorted in <strong>non-decreasing order</strong>.</p>

<p>The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be <em>stored inside the array </em><code>nums1</code>. To accommodate this, <code>nums1</code> has a length of <code>m + n</code>, where the first <code>m</code> elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last <code>n</code> elements are set to <code>0</code> and should be ignored. <code>nums2</code> has a length of <code>n</code>.</p>

<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0], m = 3, nums2 = [2,5,6], n = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> [1,2,2,3,5,6]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [1,2,3] and [2,5,6].
The result of the merge is [<u>1</u>,<u>2</u>,2,<u>3</u>,5,6] with the underlined elements coming from nums1.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [1], m = 1, nums2 = [], n = 0
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [1] and [].
The result of the merge is [1].
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> nums1 = [0], m = 0, nums2 = [1], n = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> [1]
<strong>Explanation:</strong> The arrays we are merging are [] and [1].
The result of the merge is [1].
Note that because m = 0, there are no elements in nums1. The 0 is only there to ensure the merge result can fit in nums1.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>nums1.length == m + n</code></li>
	<li><code>nums2.length == n</code></li>
	<li><code>0 &lt;= m, n &lt;= 200</code></li>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= m + n &lt;= 200</code></li>
	<li><code>-10<sup>9</sup> &lt;= nums1[i], nums2[j] &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow up: </strong>Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in <code>O(m + n)</code> time?</p>
